        {% endif %}
        Note: This is just my suggestion for ideal progression!
        Do whatever works for you!
        <h2>Just starting off</h2>
        So you just joined Pickaxe and want to know how to progress.
        <ol>
            <li>Mine {{ item("Dirt (Item)") }}, then sell it at the NPC to the left of spawn.</li>
            <li>Once you have enough for a {{ item("Wooden Shovel") }} ($50), buy it from the shop to the left of the NPC.</li>
            <li>Use your new {{ item("Wooden Shovel") }} to mine {{ item("Dirt (Item)") }} faster, selling it when you can. Note that you might also want to forge the {{ item("Dirt (Item)") }} into an {{ item("Earth Crystal") }}, since this sells for more than just selling 5 {{ item("Dirt (Item)") }}.</li>
            <li>Once you have enough for a {{ item("Stone Pick") }} ($100), buy it from the shop. This has breaking power 1, allowing you to mine {{ block("Stone (Block)") }}.</li>
            <li>Keep mining and selling items to get more money. You'll probably want to purchase the {{ item("Miner's Helmet") }} ($500) and the {{ item("Miner's Chestplate") }} ($8,000). You'll also probably want to get better pickaxes from the shop.</li>
            <li>Once you have $25,000, buy the {{ item("Aeroboots") }}. These allow you to get safely towards lower levels by giving you slow falling.</li>
        </ol>
        <h2>Meteorite Pickaxe</h2>
        Alright, let's kick things up a notch and get ourselves a {{ item("Meteorite Pickaxe") }}.
        <ol>
            <li>First, we need to get a {{ item("Diamond Pickaxe") }}. Either buy it from the shop for $21,500 or craft it from two {{ item("Budget Diamond Pickaxe") }}s and a {{ item("Glue") }}.</li>
            <li>Now make a {{ item("Netherite Ingot") }} and craft it with your {{ item("Diamond Pickaxe") }} to create a {{ item("Netherite Pickaxe") }}. Better, but not quite where our goal is.</li>
            <li>Next, make 5 {{ item("Glue") }} and forge them into a {{ item("Super Glue") }}.</li>
            <li>Now comes the annoying part. Mine 5 {{ item("Boron Nitride") }} and be ready to forge them into a {{ item("Wurtzite Boron Nitride") }}. For the long forge time, there's two things that you can do to mitigate this:</li>
            <ol>
                <li>Log off for a while until it's finished</li>
                <li>Make some fuel chunks ({{ item("Lesser Fuel Chunk") }}, {{ item("Greater Fuel Chunk") }}, {{ item("Super Fuel Chunk") }}) to speed up the forging</li>
            </ol>
            <li>Once you have that, buy a {{ item("Hat of Knowledge") }} from the nether shop. When worn, you will be able to see Tier 1 recipes in the crafting table.</li>
            <li>Now you can craft yourself a {{ item("Boron Nitride Pickaxe") }}. Make sure to wear the {{ item("Hat of Knowledge") }}, since this is a Tier 1 recipe.</li>
            <li>Now collect 3 {{ item("Magma Gem") }}s. You will need this for the {{ item("Meteorite Pickaxe") }}.</li>
            <li>Wait until meteors fall to collect as much {{ item("Meteorite") }} as you can. You'll need 13.</li>
            <li>Assuming you don't have any radiation protection, this will put you at 65% radiation. You can mitigate this by forging two {{ item("Meteorite Bar") }}s, bringing you down to 55%.</li>
            <li>Now you can finally craft the {{ item("Meteorite Pickaxe") }}!</li>
        </ol>
        <h2>Hat of Wisdom</h2>
        Let's upgrade our {{ item("Hat of Knowledge") }} to a {{ item("Hat of Wisdom") }}.
        <ol>
            <li>Mine {{ block("Soul Soil") }} and {{ block("Warped Hyphae") }} for {{ item("Soul Fragments") }} and {{ item("Soul Shard") }}s, forging them until you have 2 {{ item("Soul") }}s.</li>
            <li>In the area directly above the End Stone layer, you'll find {{ block("Polished Basalt") }}. Mine it until you get a {{ item("Boron Nitride") }}.</li>
            <li>Mine in the End Stone layer for {{ block("Sea Lantern") }}s so you can get {{ item("Starite") }}. Forge five of them into a single {{ item("Celestial Ingot") }}.</li>
            <li>Finally, grind for money until you have $32,000. This will allow you to buy 4 {{ item("Gemstone Mixture") }}s from the Nether hub.</li>
            <li>Now you can craft yourself a {{ item("Hat of Wisdom") }}!</li>
        </ol>
        <h2>Void Cutter</h2>
        Let's get ourselves a REAL pickaxe!
        <ol>
            <li>Mine in the End Stone layer for {{ block("Sea Lantern") }}s so you can get {{ item("Starite") }}. Forge five of them into a single {{ item("Celestial Ingot") }}, continuing until you can forge five of them into a {{ item("Celestial Artefact") }}.</li>
            <li>Continue mining in the End Stone layer for {{ item("Adamantium Scraps") }}. You'll need 8.</li>
            <li>Get the materials for 3 {{ item("Netherite Ingot") }}s and craft them. Use two of them to get {{ item("Adamantium") }}.</li>
            <li>Mine 10 {{ item("Boron Nitride") }} and then forge them into 2 {{ item("Wurtzite Boron Nitride") }}. Again, this will take some time.</li>
            <li>Finally, you should have all of the materials to craft a {{ item("Void Cutter") }}! Make sure to transfer any enchantments off of the pickaxe you've been using beforehand, and remember to wear your {{ item("Hat of Wisdom") }} to be able to craft it.</li>
        </ol>
        <h2>Void Cutter+</h2>
        Ready for an upgrade?
        <ol>
            <li>Mine {{ item("Void Shard") }}s from the Void layer. You'll need 10. Ensure that you don't die from void pressure! If you can't reach it, try crafting some Voidwalker armor ({{ item("Voidwalker Helmet") }}, {{ item("Voidwalker Chestplate") }}, {{ item("Voidwalker Leggings") }}, {{ item("Voidwalker Aeroboots") }}).</li>
            <li>Gather a {{ item("Magnesium Ingot") }}, a {{ item("Steel") }} ingot, a {{ item("Celestial Ingot") }}, and 2 {{ item("Adamantium Scraps") }}.</li>
            <li>Also craft a {{ item("Celestial Crowbar") }}. You'll need a lot of {{ item("Starite") }} as well as an {{ item("Empowered Crowbar") }}.</li>
            <li>Craft a {{ item("Void Alloy") }} from the materials you have.</li>
            <li>Now you can craft a {{ item("Void Cutter+") }}! Again, make sure to transfer enchantments off of it.</li>
        </ol>
        <h2>Hat of Ominescence</h2>
        Let's get to Tier 3 crafting! You should have a full set of Voidwalker armor by this point, as well as the Pristine enchantment.
        <ol>
            <li>Mine {{ item("Void Shard") }}s and forge them until you have 2 {{ item("Void Orb") }}s.</li>
            <li>Mine an {{ item("Omega Shard") }} from the bottom of the mine. This takes a LOT of time to mine and only one or two spawn per mine reset, so if none show up, try later.</li>
            <li>Mine an {{ item("Arkenstone Fragment") }}. Only one spawns per mine reset, but the depth is visible in a sign in the Nether hub. Mine under the large platform with the door above it and you should find this sign.</li>
            <li>Gather enough {{ item("Cheese") }} to forge a {{ item("Refined Topaz") }}.</li>
            <li>Gather enough {{ item("Amethyst") }} to forge a {{ item("Refined Amethyst") }}.</li>
            <li>Mine a single {{ item("Ender Ore") }}.</li>
            <li>I hope you found a {{ item("Sage Crystal") }} in a chest or bought one with some Waluigi tickets... You'll need one of those too.</li>
            <li>One last thing you need is either another {{ item("Hat of Wisdom") }} or a fully upgraded Big Smart perk in the museum.</li>
            <li>Finally you can craft yourself a {{ item("Hat of Ominescence") }}!</li>
        </ol>
        <h2>Omega Cutter</h2>
        One last guide! Here's how you can make a really good pickaxe:
        <ol>
            <li>Get 3 {{ item("Omega Shard") }}s. Yes, it's a pain.</li>
            <li>Gather the other materials needed for an {{ item("Omega Alloy") }}, minus the Shard.</li>
            <li>Forge yourself a {{ item("Gold Block") }}.</li>
            <li>Craft an {{ item("Omega Alloy") }}, and then you can make yourself an {{ item("Omega Cutter") }}!</li>
        </ol>
        You've made it this far... now what?

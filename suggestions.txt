From Spore:
    Allow favoriting a page that is displayed on the right or top side of the website.
    If you made it data in the URL you could bookmark specific favorites. IE if I am going water mining I would only need the Gills and hematite pages pulled up. or I could share a group of favorites.

    Add all armor and all tools section for more ease to search throught them and (optional: can you make the order like all the void armor after the other and same for other and make some tool in crafting recipe order for example void cutter than void cutter+ then omega)

    (like all of the ender dust you need for mesa)
